Choose a self-explaining name for your project.
> This is a student engineering project for 43019 Design in Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems project at University of Technology Sydney, Spring 2025.
> The project is to develop a system for blind and low vision sailors, in partnership with [sailability NSW](https://sailabilitynsw.com.au/).

<!-- TODO put a picture of the system in here -->


## Installation
This system is developed with PlatformIO. 

<!-- Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. -->


## Usage

<!-- Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. -->

When you are building the code on a new device, first choose the `set_device` enviroment and follow the serial monitor prompts.
Future systems should run the `env:boat` or `env:buoy` as required.


<!-- ## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc. -->


## Project status, Roadmap, and Contributing
Our run with this project has ended. We're excited for future UTS student teams to adopt this project.
Future UTS teams should first read the internally provided documentation.
